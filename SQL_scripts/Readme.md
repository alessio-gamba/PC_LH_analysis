The following files are the scripts performed for the analysis reported in the manuscript entitled ‘Quantitative Analysis of the Disease-associated Proteins that Cause Locus Heterogeneity and are Members of the Same Protein Complex’ by Gamba A, Salmona M and Bazzoni G (Revised December 11, 2019)

1. 01_diseases_all: the OMIM-derived genetic diseases
2. 02_complexes: the Gene Ontology (GO)-derived protein complexes (PC)
3. 03_ps_based_LH_PC: the intersections of the PS-based LH DGP and the PC
4. 04_disease_based_LH: the intersections of the PS-based LH DGP and the PC

The analysis has been conducted using SQLite (version 3.23.1).
